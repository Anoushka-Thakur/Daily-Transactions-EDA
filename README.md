#  Daily Household Transactions Analysis

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes **daily household financial transactions** to understand spending behavior, income patterns, and money management efficiency. Using real-world transaction data, the analysis focuses on **income vs expense trends, category-wise spending, and time-based insights**.

The project is designed as an **intermediate-level Data Analyst portfolio project**, emphasizing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and business interpretation rather than heavy machine learning.

##  Objectives

* Analyze daily household income and expenses
* Identify major spending categories
* Track daily and monthly expense trends
* Understand seasonal or periodic spending behavior
* Derive actionable financial insights and recommendations

---

##  Dataset Description

The dataset contains daily transaction-level records with the following key columns:

* **Date** – Transaction date
* **Category** – Main expense/income category
* **Subcategory** – Detailed classification (optional)
* **Income/Expense** – Transaction type
* **Amount** – Transaction value
* **Note** – Additional description (if available)

---

##  Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Pandas & NumPy** – Data cleaning and manipulation
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code**

##  Project Workflow

### 1️. Data Loading & Understanding

* Imported CSV data
* Reviewed data types, missing values, and structure

### 2️. Data Cleaning

* Converted Date column to proper datetime format
* Handled missing values in Subcategory and Note
* Ensured Amount column is numeric

### 3️. Feature Engineering

* Extracted **Year, Month, Day** from Date
* Created month names for better readability

### 4️. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Total **Income vs Expense comparison**
* **Daily expense trend** analysis
* **Monthly income and expense trends**
* **Category-wise expense breakdown**
* **Expense heatmap (Month × Category)**

### 5️. Business Insights

* Identified top expense categories
* Detected high-spending months
* Analyzed income stability vs expense volatility

---

##  Key Insights

* Expenses are concentrated in a few major categories
* Monthly expense spikes indicate seasonal spending
* Income is relatively stable compared to expenses
* Better categorization can improve expense tracking

---

##  Recommendations

* Monitor top 3 expense categories to improve savings
* Set monthly expense limits for high-spend months
* Reduce unclassified ("Others") transactions
* Use trend insights for budget planning

---

##  Conclusion

This project demonstrates a **complete EDA workflow with business storytelling**. It highlights practical financial analysis skills relevant to **Data Analyst and Business Analyst roles** and showcases the ability to convert raw data into meaningful insights.
